# Deployment Access Approval Bot

## Overview

This Slack bot facilitates the approval process for deployments and access requests. When a Jenkins job is triggered, the bot sends a message to a specified Slack channel or user. The message contains options to approve or reject the deployment, along with the name of the Jenkins job that initiated the request.

## Features

- Sends Slack messages with approval options (Approve/Reject).
- Includes the name of the Jenkins job in the Slack message.
- Integrates with Jenkins to handle deployment and access requests.
- Waits for API response to continue with the action (e.g., granting access to a database or other services).

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and configured.
- Slack workspace and bot token for sending messages.
- API endpoint for handling approval requests.
- Python 3.x installed.

## How It Works

1. **Jenkins Job Trigger**: When a Jenkins job is triggered, it calls the API implemented in this code.
2. **Slack Notification**: The API sends a Slack message with the approval options (Approve/Reject) and the Jenkins job's name.
3. **User Interaction**: Users can approve or reject the deployment directly from the Slack message.
4. **API Response**: Once a decision is made, the API receives the response and continues with the corresponding action, such as granting access to a database.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeploymentAccessApprovalBot.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure environment variables for Slack token and API endpoint.

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
